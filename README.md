# reactnative-redux-boilerplate
React Native & Redux starter that gives you a nice file structure to get you setup

# What is it?
- A simple starter App that integrates Redux into React Native giving you a nice file structure to start making your next app. A counter is presented and on incremenet the counters state is incremeneted by 1. On decrement the counters state is decremented by 1. Gives a nice simple flow of the Redux architecture which I would advise you read more about Redux http://redux.js.org before using this starter.
